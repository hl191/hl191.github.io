# Learning Angular

I am learning Angular from scratch right now. So it might have some issues but I set up my initial playground repository.

You can check it out [here](https://github.com/hl191/angular-playground).

So far features are:

1. [Reactive forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms)
2. [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) Input Fields
3. Initial Data from a service and Observable
